introduction
MenuAppMakanan is a mobile application developed to make it easier to manage and select food menus. This application is designed with the aim of assisting users in finding a variety of food options that suit their preferences and needs, be it for cooking at home or choosing the right restaurant. The app allows users to explore a variety of foods according to prices and tastes.

This application was developed by Samsul Al Maarif (NIM 312310286) as part of the Pemograman Mobile course taught by Mr. Donny Maulan, S.kom., M.M.S.I. at Pelita Bangsa University. MenuAppFood not only aims to meet daily needs, but also provides creative solutions in choosing healthy, practical, and delicious food menus.

Philosophy
The name MenuAppMakanan is taken from a simple but important concept in everyday life: menu makanan. Food is an integral part of our routine, affecting our health, mood, and quality of life. The philosophy of this application is to give users the freedom to manage and plan their food menus more easily, practically, and deliciously. In other words, this app becomes a “digital guide” for a healthier and more enjoyable daily life through a variety of food menu choices.

Just like a menu that can be tailored to taste, MenuAppMeals strives to be a flexible and innovative tool to create a dining experience that not only fills the stomach, but also provides satisfaction and happiness.

Purpose
In the midst of busy and busy routines, choosing and preparing healthy and appropriate food is often a challenge in itself. MenuAppMakanan comes with the main goal of making it easier for users to find and choose food menus that are not only delicious, but also nutritious. This application helps users to find recipes based on ingredients at home, set meal schedules, and provide restaurant recommendations that suit their preferences, such as healthy food, fast food, or regional specialties.

With the advent of MenuAppMakanan, it is hoped that users can save time, make smarter decisions about the food they consume, and ultimately improve their quality of life through more regular and balanced eating habits. The app focuses on providing comfort and convenience in every food choice taken, making it more than just an app — it’s also a partner in the user’s daily culinary journey.
